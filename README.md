## RED
### RIP 2019 - 2023.
### Was used in over 2230 servers.

A discord bot written in java with [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and a custom written wrapper to the roblox api.

This project was forced due to discord enforcing slash commands. Although I took it as a chance to properly learn java, in a larger project. If you look through the code, you will quickly notice the bodged style that some of the code has, althought I started this project some time ago, I ended up doing the majority of it a few days before I had to have it finished. As I write this, it is 20 to midnight - a supposed 20 mins before the old RED would error and go offline. I cannot express the pain in which updating this has brought, but it's done now. 

##### If you would like to self host....
If you do this, make sure you follow the license, I really don't want anyone claiming this as their own or using it to be malicious or gain access to other people servers.

But anyway if you want to host it, run the released jar file in the same directory as a properties.config file.
The following fields are...
discordSecret (the discord bot secret) and bloxLinkToken (a bloxLinkToken that is optional to add if you want to use the bloxlink api)

Hopefully all will enjoy,
Vigus.
