This project was forced due to discord enforcing slash commands. Although I took it as a chance to properly learn java, in a larger project. If you look through the code, you will quickly notice the bodged style that some of the code has, althought I started this project some time ago, I ended up doing the majority of it a few days before I had to have it finished. As I write this, it is 20 to midnight - a supposed 20 mins before the old RED would error and go offline. I cannot express the pain in which updating this has brought, but it's done now. 

Hopefully all will enjoy,
Vigus.
